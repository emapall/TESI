Obviously, we hope that given a certain control and initial condition, the solution to \eqref{e1.1} is unique, but a-priori it cannot be said.\\
The geometrical interpretation of the adjoint equation is more subtle, but, in a naive way, one could say that, given an optimal trajectory, the adjoint response is a vector orthogonal to the hyerplane given by (the directions of ) the possible (infinitesimal) variations to that trajectory.
